<h3>Backend with Spring Boot:</h3> 

The backend part of the application is built using the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot is a popular and robust tool that enables fast and efficient development of Java applications, providing an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to organize the code.<br><br>

<h3>Frontend with React:</h3> 

The frontend part of the application is developed using React, an open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is known for its focus on reusable components, allowing for a fast and interactive user experience.<br><br>

<h3>Communication between Frontend and Backend:</h3> 

Spring Boot is used to develop an API that acts as a communication interface between the frontend and the backend. React uses this API through the useEffect hook to make a request to the Spring Boot backend RESTful API when the component is first mounted. It then uses the useState hook to store the advertisement data fetched in the advertisements state, allowing it to be displayed in the UI and kept up to date as it changes.<br><br>
